# vagen

## What is vagen?

vagen is a verilogA testbench generator that can be used for transient verification of complex analog IPs.
It provides a wide range of basic models with voltage sources, current sources, digital interfaces, clocks, switches, and source measure units. 


## How to run

You can run an example of the verilogA test bench generator by typing the following command in a terminal:

```
    python3 example.py
```

## TODO

Although usable, the current development status is beta. There are several things that still need to be done:

* Improve the test bench of the code vagen/hilevelmod.py.
* Write a documentation.
